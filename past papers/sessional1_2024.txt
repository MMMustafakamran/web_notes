Question 1 [3*4=12 Marks]
i.	Define the types of CSS and explain their pros and cons with scenario [4 Marks]
Inline CSS is useful when applying unique or temporary styles to specific elements. Quick and easy to implement directly within HTML elements using the style attribute. Overrides external and internal styles, providing immediate control over individual elements. Difficult to apply consistent styling across multiple elements.
Internal CSS is suitable for small to medium-sized projects where styles are specific to a single HTML document. Provides better organization compared to inline CSS. Allows for styling multiple elements within a single HTML document. Styles are not reusable across multiple HTML pages unless copied and pasted.
External CSS is ideal for large-scale projects with multiple HTML pages, where consistent styling is essential. Separates content from presentation. Allows for centralized management of styles across multiple HTML documents. May lead to conflicts or unintended styling changes if selectors are not properly scoped or overridden.

ii.	What is HTML 5? Explain about Semantic HTML tags. [4 Marks]
HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language. Bring more new elements i.e. date, color and added more attributes in existing elements i.e. required etc.
Semantic HTML tags in HTML5 are elements that carry meaning beyond just presentation or formatting. They provide context and structure to the content of a web page, making it more accessible to both users and search engines. i.e. header, nav, footer etc.

iii.	What is MERN stack and what is the role of JavaScript in it? Also, discuss about JavaScript language; is it same as C++ or other high-level programming languages? [4 Marks]

The MERN stack is a popular open-source web development stack used for building dynamic web applications. It consists of four key technologies: MongoDB for database, Express as a backend server, React as a frontend: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Node as a backend: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment
