Writing Style Sheets in CSS:
MEAN/MERN Stack

Let us understand the differences among inline, internal, and external style sheets.
In-line styles:
●
Add styles to each tag 
within the HTML file.
●
Use it when you need 
to format just a single 
section in a web page
●
Style attribute is used 
to add style.
Example:
<h1 style=“color:red; font-
family: sans-sarif” > IU </h1>
Embedded/internal styles
●
A style is applied to the entire 
HTML file.
●
Use it when you need to modify 
all instances of particular 
element (e.g., h1) in a web 
page.
Example:
<style>
h1 {color:red; font-family:sans-serif}
</style>
External style sheet
An external style sheet is a text file containing the style definition 
(declaration)
Use it when you need to control the style for an entire website
•
Open a new blank document in Notepad
•
Type style declarations
•
h1 {color:red; font-family:calibri;}
•
Do not include <style> tags
•
Save the document as filename.css
•
Open a HTML file
•
Between <head> and </head> add 
•
<link href=URL rel=“relation_type” type=“link_type”>
•
URL is the file.css
•
Relation_type=“stylesheet”
•
Link_type=“text/css”
•
Save this file and the .css file in the same web server directory.

Understand how to declare a style:
MEAN/MERN Stack

•
A rule consists of 
•
A selector: element or elements the declaration applies to
•
Declaration: how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled
•
property: which is the property of the selected element
•
value: which is a specification for this property
Using Id’s:
•
Use an id to distinguish something, like a paragraph, from the others in a document
•
The id selector is used to specify a style for a single, unique element
•
Create a style Id:
•
#id_name {style attributes and values}
•
Use a style Id:
•
<tag ID=id_name>

Note: HTML requires each id 
be unique– therefore an id 
value can only be used once 
in a document.

or

Difference between classes and Id’s:
MEAN/MERN Stack
11
•
You can’t have more than one tag with the same ID value
•
You can apply the same Class value to multiple document tags
•
Classes or Id?
•
use ID's for any elements that are simply used once on a page
 
 
 
 
OR
•
only use classes to style websites, but, when you have to use an element in 
JavaScript, use an identifier
•
You can apply a style to many selectors if you like

CSS properties:
What is the box model?
Every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have 
width, height, padding, borders, and margins.
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and 
to define space between elements.
•
Content - The content of the box, where text and images 
appear
•
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The 
padding is transparent
•
Border - A border that goes around the padding and 
content
•
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is 
transparent
