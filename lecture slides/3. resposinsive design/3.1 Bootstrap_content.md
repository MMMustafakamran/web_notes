2.  Grid:
●
Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.
●
The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.
●
Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).

3.  Breakpoints:
●
Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a 
particular viewport or device size.
●
Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a 
layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This 
optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.
The following tables shows the break points.

3. Gutters
●
Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively 
space and align content in the Bootstrap grid system.
●
Gutters are the gaps between column content, created by horizontal 
padding. We set padding-right and padding-left on each column, and 
use negative margin to offset that at the start and end of each row to 
align content.

Badges scale to match the size of the 
immediate parent element by using 
relative font sizing and em units. 
Example:

5. Card
●
Bootstrap’s cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants 
and options.
Example:
●
Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no 
fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily 
customized with our various sizing options.

8. Collapse:
●
The collapse is used to show and hide content. 
●
Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle.
●
Collapsing an element will animate the height from its current value to 0.
●
Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use padding on a .collapse element. Instead, use the class as 
an independent wrapping element.
For examples refer the documentation.
9. Dropdowns
●
Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more.
●
They’re made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin.
●
They’re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.

12. Pagination
●
Pagination is to indicate a series of related content exists across multiple pages.
●
We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily scalable, all while 
providing large hit areas. 
●
Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links.
●
Use a wrapping <nav> element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive 
technologies.
Example:

13. Progress
●
Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes.
●
We use the .progress as a wrapper to indicate the max value of the progress bar.
●
We use the inner .progress-bar to indicate the progress so far.
●
The .progress-bar requires an inline style, utility class, or custom CSS to set their width.
●
The .progress-bar also requires some role and aria attributes to make it accessible.
Put that all together, and you have the following examples.

15. Toasts
●
Push notifications to your visitors with a toast, a lightweight and easily customizable alert message.
●
Toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and 
desktop operating systems.
●
Toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.
●
Toasts will automatically hide if you do not specify autohide: false.
●
To encourage extensible and predictable toasts, we recommend a header and body. Toast headers use display: flex, 
allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.
●
Toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup. At a minimum, we require a single element to 
contain your “toasted” content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.
