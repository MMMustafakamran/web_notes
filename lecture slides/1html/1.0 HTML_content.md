Internet
◦Inter-networking: Network of Networks
◦Internet Supports lot of diff Services just one of which is World Wide Web (WWW).
◦URL to locate data/stuff/resources render by a browser as a web page
  ( written by html language ).
◦Web is a virtual space where content is stored that can be accessed through internet 
like a road which takes you at some point.

Internet Other Services
◦Non browser based Emails Server: app like outlook using SMTP or POP which lies 
outside of the web.
◦File transfers Schemes using FTP like bittorrent which do not use http and bypass 
entirely web.
◦Other services like Spotify, Other gaming servers, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
◦Other mobile apps which do not use http port usually port 80

Now a day
Now a day all the services are available on web like email providers i.e. Hotmail, gmail 
replacing outlook…
Display documents over the internet i.e. Google Scholar website
Provide videos browsing like youtube instead of downloading the video files
Like other apps i.e. Word, google sheet
Web is also now become less popular due to different mobile apps that do not use http

What is HTML?
• HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It 
stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
• Originally, the Internet was designed as a means for distributing information across a robust, 
non centralized network of computers in a time of national emergency. 
• However, as more organizations and people adopted the Internet, the need grew for easier 
access to resources and for a richer display of information. Publishing HTML-formatted 
documents on the Internet via the World Wide Web proved to be the answer to these needs.
• Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other 
places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as 
HTML5

What is HTML?
• Markup languages prepare design of a page. These are presentational languages, and it 
doesn’t include any kind of logic or algorithm. 
• To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
• It defines the structure of webpages and determines how data is displayed online.
• HTML is used to indicate what text should be considered a heading, where paragraphs start 
and end, and what images should appear in the document, and to specify links between 
different pages. 
• It Is directly interpreted by the browser.

How HTML works
The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later lesson. 
For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design. So basically, it involves formatting 
data, or it controls the presentation of data.
HTML files have .html extension. 
HTML is not case-sensitive, multiple spaces will appear as a single space blank and new lines are ignored.
While getting started with HTML, you will likely encounter new and often strange terms. Over time you will 
become more and more familiar with all of them, but the three common HTML terms you should begin 
with are tags, elements, and attributes.

Tags
•
The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is 
known as a tag. 
•
Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.
•
An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an 
element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, <div>.
•
A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by a forward 
slash and the element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, </div>.
•
The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. An 
anchor link, for example, will have an opening tag of <a> and a closing tag of </a>. What falls 
between these two tags will be the content of the anchor link. 
<a>…Content…</a>

Elements
•
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. 
•
Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. 
•
Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified 
as <h1> through <h6> elements) and 
•
paragraphs (identified as the <p> element); 
•
the list goes on to include the <a>, <div>, <span>, <strong>, and <em> elements, and many 
more.

Attributes
Attributes:
•
Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. 
•
The most common attributes include 
•
id attribute, which identifies an element; 
•
class attribute, which classifies an element; 
•
src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and 
•
href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.
 
•
Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an element’s name. Generally, attributes include a name and a 
value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted 
attribute value. For example, an <a> element including an href attribute would look like the following:
 
 
<a href="http://somewebsite.com/">Website</a>
 
 
Or
 
<img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">
•
In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.

## Page 14

Basic Construction of an HTML Page:
•
<!DOCTYPE html> — All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
•
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to 
expect.
•
In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
•
<!DOCTYPE html>.
HTML 4.01:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
•
<html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code and signifies the beginning of 
the document.
•
<head> — Inside the <html> element, the <head> element identifies the top of the document, including any 
metadata (accompanying information about the page) goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and 
other computer programs. The content inside the <head> element is not displayed on the web page itself. 
Instead, it may include the document title (which is displayed on the title bar in the browser window), links to 
any external files, or any other beneficial metadata.
•
<body> — This is where the visible content of the page goes.

Basic Construction of an HTML Page:
•
Further Tags:
•
Inside the <head> tag, there is one tag that is always included: <title>, but there are others that are just as important:
•
<title> - This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.
•
<meta> - This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.
•
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. The HTML5 specification encourages web 
developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world

How to Add HTML Headings To Your Web Page:
In HTML, headings are written in the following elements:
●
As you might have guessed <h1> and <h2> should be used for the most important titles, while the 
remaining tags should be used for sub-headings and less important text.
●
Search engine bots use this order when deciphering which information is most important on a page.
●
We will save this file as “index.html” in a new folder called “my webpage.”

Page:
How To Add Text In HTML:
•
Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the 
tag <p> which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular text 
inside the element <p>.
•
When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we 
can use to control the text or make it appear in a certain way.
Note:
•
Because both the heading and paragraph are nested within the <body> 
element, they are visible on the web page.
•
When an element is placed inside of another element, also known as 
nested, it is a good idea to indent that element to keep the document 
structure well organized and legible. 
•
In the previous code, both the <head> and <body> elements were nested 
and indented inside the <html> element. The pattern of indenting for 
elements continues as new elements are added inside the <head> and 
<body> elements.

Comments:
You can put comments between any tags in your HTML documents. Comments use the following syntax: 
Anything after will not be displayed. It can still be seen in the source code for the document, but it is not 
shown on screen. 
Note: 
●
It is good practice to comment your code, especially in complex documents

Comments help you and others understand your code.
