Basic Construction of an HTML Page:

HTML Links and navigation
Internal Links: When you link to another page in your own website, the link is known as an internal link. 
Links pointing to other pages of the same website will have a relative path, which does not include the 
domain (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value. Because the link is pointing to another page on 
the same website, the href attribute value needs to include only the filename of the page being linked to: 
pagename.html
External Links: When you link to a different site, it is known as an external link. Linking to other websites 
outside of the current one requires an absolute path, where the href attribute value must include the full 
domain. A link to Google would need the href attribute value of http://google.com, starting with http and 
including the domain, .com in this case.
How to link pages?
Anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes part of the link that users can 
click in a browser. To link another page, href attribute of opening tag of <a> is used the value of the href 
attribute is the name of the file you are linking to. For example: <a href=“abc.html”>Click here</a>

Adding images to web pages
Images are usually added to a site using the <img> element. It must carry the src attribute indicating the 
source of the image and an alt attribute whose value is an alternate description (alt) for the image in case 
it does not load or the user has a visual impairment.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The <img> tag has two required attributes:
●
src - Specifies the path to the image
●
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
SRC attribute of the <img> tag is used to indicate the source of the image
