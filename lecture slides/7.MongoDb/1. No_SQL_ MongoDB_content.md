Introduction
1.
MongoDB is a No SQL database. It is an open-source, cross-platform, document-oriented database written in C++.
2.
It is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.
3.
In simple words, you can say that - Mongo DB is a document-oriented database. It is an open source product, developed and supported by a company 
named 10gen.
4.
MongoDB is a cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. 
5.
MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.
Installation:
●
Download a free MongoDB database at https://www.mongodb.com.
●
Or get started right away with a MongoDB cloud service at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.
Database
Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple 
databases.
Collection
Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a 
schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.
Document
A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the 
same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

Following example shows the document structure of a blog site, which is simply a comma separated key value pair.

Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS
●
Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number 
of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
●
Structure of a single object is clear.
●
No complex joins.
●
Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as 
powerful as SQL.
●
Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.
●
Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
●
Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.
Why Use MongoDB?
●
Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.
●
Index on any attribute
●
Replication and high availability
●
Rich queries
●
Fast in-place updates
●
Professional support by MongoDB

The use Command
●
MongoDB use DATABASE_NAME is used to create database. The command will create a new database if it doesn't exist, otherwise it will return the 
existing database.
Syntax
●
Basic syntax of use DATABASE statement is as follows −
use DATABASE_NAME
Example
If you want to use a database with name <mydb>, then use DATABASE statement would be as follows −
>use mydb
switched to db mydb
To check your currently selected database, use the command db
>db
mydb
If you want to check your databases list, use the command show dbs.

The dropDatabase() Method
MongoDB db.dropDatabase() command is used to drop an existing database.
Syntax
Basic syntax of dropDatabase() command is as follows 
db.dropDatabase()
This will delete the selected database. If you have not selected any database, then it will delete default 'test' database.
Example
First, check the list of available databases by using the command, show dbs.
>show dbs
local   0.78125GB
mydb    0.23012GB
test    0.23012GB
>
If you want to delete new database <mydb>, then dropDatabase() command would be as follows −
>use mydb
switched to db mydb
>db.dropDatabase()
>{ "dropped" : "mydb", "ok" : 1 }
>

The createCollection() Method
MongoDB db.createCollection(name, options) is used to create collection.
Syntax
Basic syntax of createCollection() command is as follows:-
db.createCollection(name, options)
In the command, name is name of collection to be created. Options is a document and is used to specify configuration of collection.
Parameter
Type
Description
Name
String
Name of the collection to be created
Options
Document
(Optional) Specify options about memory size 
and indexing

Options parameter is optional, so you need to specify only the name of the collection. Following is the list of options you can use −
Field
Type
Description
capped
Boolean
(Optional) If true, enables a capped collection. Capped collection 
is a fixed size collection that automatically overwrites its oldest 
entries when it reaches its maximum size. If you specify true, you 
need to specify size parameter also.
autoIndexId
Boolean
(Optional) If true, automatically create index on _id field.s Default 
value is false.
size
number
(Optional) Specifies a maximum size in bytes for a capped 
collection. If capped is true, then you need to specify this field 
also.
max
number
(Optional) Specifies the maximum number of documents allowed 
in the capped collection.


---

## Page 11

While inserting the document, MongoDB first checks size field of capped collection, then it checks max field.
Examples
Basic syntax of createCollection() method without options is as follows:-
>use test
switched to db test
>db.createCollection("mycollection")
{ "ok" : 1 }
>
You can check the created collection by using the command show collections.
>show collections
mycollection
system.indexes
The following example shows the syntax of createCollection() method with few important options −
> db.createCollection("mycol", { capped : true, autoIndexID : true, size : 6142800, max : 10000 } ){
 "ok" : 0,
 "errmsg" : "BSON field 'create.autoIndexID' is an unknown field.",
 "code" : 40415,
 "codeName" : "Location40415"
 }
 >

In MongoDB, you don't need to create collection. MongoDB creates collection automatically, when you insert some document.
>db.new_collection.insert({"name" : "Hello"}),
WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
The drop() Method
MongoDB's db.collection.drop() is used to drop a collection from the database.
Syntax
Basic syntax of drop() command is as follows:
db.COLLECTION_NAME.drop()
Example
First, check the available collections into your database mydb.
>use mydb
switched to db mydb
>show collections
mycol
mycollection
>

Now drop the collection with the name mycollection.
>db.mycollection.drop()
true
Again check the list of collections into database.
>show collections
mycol
drop() method will return true, if the selected collection is dropped successfully, otherwise it will return false.
The insert() Method
To insert data into MongoDB collection, you need to use MongoDB's insert() or save() method.
Syntax
The basic syntax of insert() command is as follows:
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.insert(document)

Query Documents:
The find() Method
To query data from MongoDB collection, you need to use MongoDB's find() method.
Syntax
The basic syntax of find() method is as follows:
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.find()
find() method will display all the documents in a non-structured way.
For more details on Query Documents visit MongoDB official documentation.
MongoDB Update() Method
The update() method deletes the values in the existing document.
Syntax
The basic syntax of update() method is as follows:
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.update(SELECTION_CRITERIA, UPDATED_DATA)

MongoDB Save() Method
The save() method replaces the existing document with the new document passed in the save() method.
Syntax
The basic syntax of MongoDB save() method is shown below −
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.save({_id:ObjectId(),NEW_DATA})
The remove() Method
MongoDB's remove() method is used to remove a document from the collection. remove() method accepts two parameters. One is deletion criteria and second is 
justOne flag.
●
deletion criteria − (Optional) deletion criteria according to documents will be removed.
●
justOne − (Optional) if set to true or 1, then remove only one document.
Syntax
Basic syntax of remove() method is as follows
db.COLLECTION_NAME.remove(DELLETION_CRITTERIA)

Remove Only One
If there are multiple records and you want to delete only the first record, then set justOne parameter in remove() method.
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.remove(DELETION_CRITERIA,1)
Remove All Documents
If you don't specify deletion criteria, then MongoDB will delete whole documents from the collection. This is equivalent of SQL's truncate command.
> db.mycol.remove({})
WriteResult({ "nRemoved" : 2 })
> db.mycol.find()
>
